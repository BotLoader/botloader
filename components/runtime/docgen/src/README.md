# Botloader scripting API documentation

This is the reference for the Botloader typescript API.

At the core, all scripts have a `script` global variable defined that you use to interact with the bot. see the [[Script]] class for more info on what you can do with it.

Everything is exported under the `botloader` module. Example import: `import { discord } from 'botloader';`

For example scripts join the discord and check the examples channel.
