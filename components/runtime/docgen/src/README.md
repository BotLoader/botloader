# Botloader scripting API documentation

This is the reference for the Botloader runtime typescript API.

At the core, all scripts have a `script` global variable defined that you use to interact with the bot. see the [[Script]] class for more info on what you can do with it.

Everything is exported under the `botloader` module. 
Example import: `import { Discord, Tasks } from 'botloader';`

For example scripts join the discord and check the examples channel.
