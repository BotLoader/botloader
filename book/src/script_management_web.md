# Script development on the web browser

Note: the web editor does not support mobile.

To manage your servers scripts, you log onto the website, click select server in the top right and select your server.

After that you will have a sidebar on the left, click on the "scripts" entry to manage your server scripts.

From here you can create, delete and toggle a scripts enabled/disabled status. 

If you click on the `edit` button you will be taken to the web editor based on `Monaco`.

In the web editor you will have full intellisense and autocomplete support.

To deploy your changes simply press `ctrl-s` or the save button on the right.
