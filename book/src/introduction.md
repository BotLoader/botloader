# Intro

Botloader is a programmable discord bot with no default functionality. Any functionality has to be added by the server admins.

The bot is programmed using typescript and you program it either through the vs code extension or using the web based editor.

This book contains various guides to creating botloader scripts.

**This book is relatively new and WIP, some sections are incomplete and some are not started at all**
