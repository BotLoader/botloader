# Intro

Botloader is a hosted programmable discord bot with no default functionality. Any functionality has to be added by the server admins.

The bot is programmed using typescript and you can program it either through the Visual Studio Code extension or using the web based editor.

This book contains various guides to creating botloader scripts.

Note that this book is still relatively WIP.
